>Chacha20 is a 20 round stream cipher (symmetric key cryptosystem) designed by D.J. Bernstein. It is highly recommended by the designer for typical cryptographic applications as it is consistently faster than AES.


>Blake2b is a cryptographic hash function designed by Jean-Philippe Aumasson, released on January 13, 2013. It does not require a special "HMAC" (Hashed Message Authentication Code) construction for keyed message authentication as it has a built-in keying mechanism. It produces a digest based on the message and the key, which is used to verify data integrity and the authenticity of the message. Receiver can make out if the message has been forged by the adversary.


## Requirements

This project uses following listed tech:

- C++ - general Purpose programming Language (version 17+)
- Node JS - evented I/O for the backend
- React - library for building user interfaces


## Installation and Usage
This project requires C++ v17 compiler, make sure you have gcc installed.
***
**Run via Command Line Interface**
InputFiles : Input Files Directory
OutputFiles: Output Files Directory

| Input File Name | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| input_plain_txt_message.txt | Any arbitrary length string |
| chacha20_key.txt | A 256-bit key, treated as a concatenation of eight 32-bit little-endian integers |
| chacha20_nonce.txt | A 96-bit nonce, treated as a concatenation of three 32-bit little-endian integers |
| chacha20_counter.txt | A 32-bit block count parameter (can be any number, but usually set to 0 or 1), treated as a 32-bit little-endian integer |
| blake2b-512_key.txt | Variable length key (0 <= kk <= 64) |
| blake2b-512_digest_size.txt | The number of bytes the user wants in the hash, the maximum is 64 |

After setting up the inputs in the above files, run the following command ( blake2b-512 files are required during authenticated operation)
```
bash execute.sh  [0:without authentication, 1:with authentication] [0: disable forging, 1: forged by adversary]
```


The Result/Output will be written in the OutputFiles Directory

| Output File Name| Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| decrypted_text.txt | Decrypted text |
| cipher_text_generated_by_Alice.txt | Cipher text generated by Alice |
| cipher_text_reaching_Bob.txt | Cipher text reaching Bob |
| hash_alice | Hash of Alice |
| hash_bob | Hash of Bob |
| tag_verification_result.txt | Result of tag verificartion |
